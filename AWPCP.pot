"It appears you have a potential problem that could result in the "
"malfunctioning of Another Wordpress Classifieds plugin. A check of your "
"database was performed and duplicate entries were found that share the same "
"post_name value as your classifieds page. If for some reason you uninstall "
"and then reinstall this plugin and the duplicate pages remain in your "
"database, it could break the plugin and prevent it from working. To fix this "
"problem you can manually delete the duplicate pages and leave only the page "
"with the ID of your real classifieds page, or you can use the link below to "
"rebuild your classifieds page. The process will include first deleting all "
"existing pages with a post name value identical to your classifieds page. "
"Note that if you recreate the page, it will be assigned a new page ID so if "
"you are referencing the classifieds page ID anywhere outside of the "
"classifieds program you will need to adjust the old ID to the new ID."
