"It appears you have a potential problem that could result in the "

"and then reinstall this plugin and the duplicate pages remain in your "
"database, it could break the plugin and prevent it from working. To fix this "

"with the ID of your real classifieds page, or you can use the link below to "
"rebuild your classifieds page. The process will include first deleting all "
"existing pages with a post name value identical to your classifieds page. "
